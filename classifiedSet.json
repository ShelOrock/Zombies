I know I'd need to do something with my new array to get rid of  new opposite directions  but I thought the code below should  at least remoce the redundancies in the first array.

However, I'm getting error messages like the one attached, there is some incrementer thing going on.

It's always going to be the index of the current item in the array that your reduce function is iterating over. So on the first run-through, it's going to be 0, then 1, then 2, etc.  That should get you in the right direction.Now, to get the value of the previous slot in the array, note that the 4th parameter you can pass to reduce's callback will be the source array.

Remember to account for edge cases.  -Ziv","output":{"documentation":1,"array":1}},{"input":"Ziv's answer was very helpful for understanding how to access the previous element of the array using reduce.  Additionally, you are going to have issues with your isOpposite function. When you write valueArray.includes('N' &amp;&amp; 'S'), that isn't saying what you think it is. That will actually first evaluate the expression 'N' &amp;&amp; 'S' which will evaluate to true. Then it will see if valueArray.includes(true), which it won't.  In order to properly check if currentValue and previousValue are opposites, you would need to do one of the following:  /* Make sure that both 'N' and 'S' exist in valueArray */ let valueArray = [previousValue, currentValue] ['N','S'].every(dir =&gt; valueArray.includes(dir))  /****** OR ********/ return (previousValue === 'N' &amp;&amp; currentValue === 'S') ||            (previousValue === 'S' &amp;&amp; currentValue === 'N')  /****** OR ********/ const opposites = {     N: 'S',     S: 'N', };  return opposites[previousValue] === currentValue;","output":{"array":1}},{"input":"I'm looking through the documentation regarding the use of .apply(). After reading MDN, I still have some confusion about the appropriate use of null as an argument.The solution code for complement function that reads:  function complement(func) {  return function ( ) {       return !func.apply(null, arguments) }  }","output":{"function":1}},{"input":"Hey Sara, that's a really good question.  The real use case for .call() and .apply() is to modify the context (this) of a function when it's called and to pass arguments to the function. So, for instance:  function logInfo(age, height) {     console.log(`Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${age}, Height: ${height}`); }  logInfo.call({ name: 'Jimmy' }, 74, 60); // Will log 'Name: Jimmy, Age: 74, Height: 60' logInfo.call({ name: 'Jenny' }, 50, 69); // Will log 'Name: Jenny, Age: 50, Height: 69'  logInfo.apply({ name: 'Jimmy' }, [74, 60]); // Will log 'Name: Jimmy, Age: 74, Height: 60' logInfo.apply({ name: 'Jenny' }, [50, 69]); // Will log 'Name: Jenny, Age: 50, Height: 69'  As you can see, both .call() and .apply() can be used for the same purposes. They both set the context (this) of the function and offer a way to pass additional arguments. The only difference between the two is how additional arguments are passed. With .call(), they are passed as normal arguments, with .apply(), they are passed as an array.  In this next example, it doesn't matter what we pass as the this argument to .call() or .apply() because the function doesn't ever reference a this.  function logInfo(age, height) {     console.log(`Age: ${age}, Height: ${height}`); }  logInfo.call({ name: 'Jimmy' }, 74, 60); // Will log 'Age: 74, Height: 60' logInfo.apply(null, [74, 60]); // Will log 'Age: 74, Height: 60'  So, to finally get around to answering your question...  The function returned from complement just needs a simple way to pass all of its arguments along to func. It does that by hijacking the functionality of .apply(). .apply() is perfect for this scenario because, unlike .call(), it can pass an unlimited number of arguments to the function in a single array (the arguments object). And the reason it passes null as the context (this) is because the func doesn't care what its context (this) is. If the func doesn't ever reference this, then it doesn't matter what is passed at the first argument to .apply(). You could have passed anything there and it wouldn't have made a difference.","output":{"function":1}},{"input":"struggled with multiple maps for a long time. After looking at the solution, one of the things that was tripping me up was that I was first looping through the array of objects, then doing my for of loop. The solution below has you go right into the for of loop on the second array after you map over the first array. Can someone walk me through what's going on here? It seems to me that they wouldn't be ale to look at the individual objects in the array without first isolating those objects. Basically, it seems to me like we're doing a for of loop over an array, and it shouldn't be able to get at the values we need yet.   Solution:   function multipleMaps(input, maps) {    return input.map(function(key){        for (let map of maps) {            if(key in map) {                return map[key]            }        }        return key    })}","output":{"function":0,"array":1}},{"input":"To start with, let's use the examples given in the problem to assert that maps is expecting an array of objects, such as   [   { a: 0 },   { b: 1, c: 2 },   { d: 3 } ]  and inputs is an array of the properties we want to extract from those objects. input will be an array representing keys/properties we want to pull from those objects in map. To think about the solution, I want to clarify that it’s not that you loop the maps array after you map over the first array, it’s while..map() will, in this case, iterate over every item of input, and pass the current item to the callback function declared inside its argument list. In this case, the callback is the anonymous function that begins after .map( and ends on the second-to-last line, and the current item is referenced inside that callback with key.   The for…of is inside the callback function, so it'll be run on every item inside the input array. Remember that these items are all going to be the properties we reference in the objects stored in maps. The loop then runs through each object in maps (e.g., { a: 0} in my example above) and, ifkey` is the name of a property in that object, it returns the value associated with that property. Otherwise, it simply returns the property.  Sorry, that was a lot, but I hope it explains what's going on.

One of the things that is confusing me about the TestFirst solution is that the key is being matched but it's not accounting for the fact that there are different types (string and number) in the different test cases.

However, using es6 syntax it would flow in the opposite direction because we can't call function expressions before they are defined as they are not hoisted.  const updateDOM = () =&gt; {  }  const addUser = () =&gt; {updateDOM()}  const getRandomUser = () =&gt; {addData()}  Is this a matter of preference?

I can comment that the parens surrounding the function allow for the IFFE  to work without an error being thrown.

Then within the function's execution context, the 'var x' declaration (but NOT x's assignment) is hoisted.  That's why you get 'undefined' as the value that is being console.logged.

Once you have found the folder open in your terminal and type \"git remote -v\". This will show you where the origin is mapped to.  It should be this:  'https://github.com/clairemuscat/TestFirst-Review-V2.git'. If there isn't one you can type \"git remote add origin https://github.com/clairemuscat/TestFirst-Review-V2.git\". This will set your origin to your repository. If you need to set a new origin you can type \"git remote set-url origin https://github.com/clairemuscat/TestFirst-Review-V2.git\"  If all that seems too confusing, you can delete the repository from your github and start fresh.

The PATH variable is just something that your computer will use to look for executable files. Any executable file that exists in the directories in your PATH variable (delimited by colons) can run without calling the full directory name (e.g. I can run python by typing \"python\" instead of \"/usr/local/python\" in my terminal). Whenever you add something to your PATH variable (e.g. export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/bin/npm), you are just adding a new path to the end of the existing PATH variable.  In your .bash_profile, the two export statements are commented out (the # at the start of the line), so that part of the script never runs.

The location of the global install is altered as a result of using n. n creates its own directory (node_modules) which is where n installs global packages.

So I have just looked at this myself, and it seems that inside of the '02-object-properties' directory, there is the 'object-properties.js' file as well as the 'object-properties-specs.js' file in the root of that directory. However, there is also a sub-directory within this one named 'object-syntax-practice', which itself has 'object-syntax.js' and 'object-syntax-specs.js'. They are separate spec and js files, hence why adding a 'dog' object to your code didn't update anything.  Since you're likely running testem from the '02-object-properties' directory, it will find both the specs at the root of '02-object-properties' as well as 'object-syntax-practice'. If you want to run the specs without the 'shortand object syntax' specs failing, open the 'object-syntax-specs.js' file and put an x in front of the describe block, e.g. 'xdescribe'. This will turn off the specs - you will still see them on your testem page in your browser, but they will neither pass nor fail. For future reference, you can do the same to individual test cases ('xit') as well.  Let me know if this helped!
